Squares on a plane are colored variously either black or white. 
We arbitrarily identify one square as the "ant". 
The ant can travel in any of the four cardinal directions at each step it takes. 
The ant moves according to the rules below:

At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

I used a simple extension to Langton's ant where instead of just two colors, more colors are used.
The colors are modified in a cyclic fashion. 
A simple naming scheme is used: for each of the successive colors, a letter "L" or "R" is used to indicate whether a left or right turn should be taken. 
Langton's ant has the name "RL" in this naming scheme.
